 GER_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "D Class"
 GER_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The D-class were a pair of cruisers. The ships were improved versions of the preceding Deutschland-class cruisers. They were intended to counter a new French naval construction program. Displacement increased to 20,000 t, but Hitler allowed only increases to armor, prohibiting additions to the ships' main battery. Only one of the two ships was laid down, but it was canceled less than five months after the keel was laid. It was determined that the designs should be enlarged to counter the new French Dunkerque-class ships. The construction contracts for both ships were superseded by the Scharnhorst-class battleships."
 #GER_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "D级"
 #GER_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "D级是一对姊妹巡洋舰，该舰是前级德意志级巡洋舰的升级型，她们原本是用来对抗法国的新造船计划的。该级舰艇的排水量达到了20,000吨，但是希特勒只允许增强其装甲，却不允许增强其主炮。两艘舰艇中只有一艘开始建造，但是在铺设龙骨后不到五个月就取消建造了。这是因为她们被要求扩大设计，以便对抗法国新的敦刻尔克级战列舰。两艘船的建造工作都被沙恩霍斯特级战列舰所取代。"

 GER_battleship_1:0 "Bayern Class"
 GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Bayern class was a class of four super-dreadnought battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine during WWI. The class comprised Bayern, Baden, Sachsen, and Württemberg. Only Baden and Bayern were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, Bayern and Baden were the last battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine during WWI."
 #GER_battleship_1:0 "巴伐利亚级"
 #GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "巴伐利亚级是帝国海军在一战期间建造的一级四艘超级无畏舰。该级军舰包括巴伐利亚号、巴登号、萨克森号与符腾堡号。由于随着战争的进行，舰船建造优先顺序的改变，只有巴登号与巴伐利亚号建造完成。因为U艇对战争的贡献更大，因此新战舰的建设被决定放缓，以至于最终完全停了下来。巴伐利亚号与巴登号也因此成为了帝国海军在一战期间最后完成的战列舰。"
 GER_carrier_2:0 "Jade Class"
 GER_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Jade class comprised a pair of passenger ships intended to be converted into auxiliary aircraft carriers. The two ships were launched as Gneisenau and Potsdam in 1935. After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting."
 #GER_carrier_2:0 "亚德河级"
 #GER_carrier_2_desc:0 "亚德河级包含了两艘原本打算改装成辅助航母的客船。这两艘船在1935年以格奈森瑙号、波茨坦号为名开始运行。战争爆发后，德国海军征用这两艘船作为运输船，并于1942年5月计划将其改装为航空母舰。这两艘船其实完全不同，但是她们尺寸相似，可以安装相同的装备。"
 GER_submarine_1:0 "Type IIA"
 GER_submarine_1_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935." 
 #GER_submarine_1:0 "IIA级"
 #GER_submarine_1_desc:0 "德国IIA级潜艇是一种带有内部压载舱的单艇壳、全焊接制造的近海潜艇。它的排水量超过了250吨并且装备了5门533毫米鱼雷发射管。该级潜艇从1934至1935年共建造了6艘。"
 GER_submarine_2:0 "Type VII"

From the prototype, the cruiser was distinguished by its large size, significantly enhanced protection and rapid-fire artillery of smaller caliber. Design development was cancelled after introduction of technical task for the new type light cruiser (Project 68). "

 SOV_battleship_3:0 "Project UP.41"
 SOV_battleship_3_desc:0 "UP.41 was a project made by Ansaldo for the Soviet Union(which eventually chose to go for Project 23 as their new battleship). The primary and secondary artillery would have a disposition with 9 406/50 mm cannons and 12 152/55 mm, very similar to the Littorio class. "

 #USA
 USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "This is a hypothetical battleship. The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 #USA_battleship_4:0 "伊利诺伊级"
 #USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "这是一艘假想的战列舰。伊利诺伊级延续了依阿华级的设计和定位。该舰维持装甲的同时提升了航速与武器。伊利诺伊级将16”/50口径的火炮数量从9个提升至12个，同时也改良了锅炉和机械用以提供更高效的巡航速度。像蒙大拿级那样，最初她被设计成装载四个4 6”口径火炮的双联炮塔，但最后恢复成5”高平两用双联炮塔炮位以最大化防空能力。"
 USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Montana Class"
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Iowa Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with the latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

 USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "This is a semi-hypothetical super-heavy battleship. BB-65-8 is originally an early blue print of Montana Class, with top-tier performence in design. Weighed 67,000 in tonnage, it has a reletively higher speed, 12 main guns and heavy protection. However its enormous size got it cancelled along with the cancellation of new navigation locks in the Panama Canal. Now with the war escalated, this blue print has came to the attention of US Navy once again."
